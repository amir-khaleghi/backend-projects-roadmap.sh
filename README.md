## Introduction

This repository is a collection of backend projects from the [roadmap.sh backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects). Each project focuses on solving real-world backend challenges and helps you build a strong foundation in various aspects of backend development, including:

- **APIs**: Building RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and more.
- **Databases**: Working with relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases.
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure login systems with OAuth, JWT, etc.
- **Caching**: Using caching techniques to optimize backend performance.
- **Microservices**: Building distributed systems and handling communication between services.

## How to Get Started

To get started with these projects, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-projects.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project you want to start:
    ```bash
    cd backend-projects/project-name
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the project's README for setup and running the server.

## Project Setup

Each project is self-contained and has its own setup instructions. Typically, you will need:

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
